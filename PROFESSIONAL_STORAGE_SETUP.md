# Professional Storage Setup for PHOTON Coaching Institute

## Current Issue
- Service accounts cannot write to personal Google Drive
- Need professional, always-connected storage solution
- No user authentication required for students/teachers

## Recommended Solution: OAuth with Server-Side Refresh Tokens

### How It Works:
1. **One-time setup**: Admin authenticates once with a dedicated Google account
2. **Server stores refresh tokens**: Tokens are stored securely on the server
3. **Automatic token refresh**: System refreshes tokens automatically
4. **Always connected**: No user interaction required
5. **Professional**: Uses dedicated coaching institute Google account

### Implementation Steps:

#### Step 1: Create Dedicated Google Account
- Create: `photoncoaching.institute@gmail.com` (or similar)
- This will be the dedicated storage account
- Only admin has access to this account

#### Step 2: Server-Side OAuth Implementation
- Store refresh tokens in environment variables
- Automatic token refresh on server
- No client-side authentication required

#### Step 3: Seamless User Experience
- Students/teachers never see login screens
- Data persists across all devices/ports
- Professional, institutional storage
