# 🔧 Teacher Dashboard API Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
The teacher dashboard is failing with "Failed to fetch available tests" because the `tests` table is missing required columns.

**Missing columns:**
- `subject` 
- `duration_minutes`
- `max_marks`
- `is_active`

## ✅ **Solution:**

### **Step 1: Run SQL Fix Script** (2 minutes)
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://qlzxzpibxqsynmnjjvne.supabase.co
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `fix-tests-table-schema.sql`
4. Click **"Run"**

This will:
- ✅ Add missing columns to tests table
- ✅ Create 3 sample tests (Math, Physics, Chemistry)
- ✅ Fix RLS policies for teacher access
- ✅ Set up proper table structure

### **Step 2: Verify Fix** (30 seconds)
```bash
node test-teacher-dashboard-api.js
```

Expected output after fix:
```
✅ Tests table structure is correct
✅ Found 3 tests in database
✅ API logic works - found X tests for this teacher
```

### **Step 3: Test Teacher Dashboard** (1 minute)
1. Go to: http://localhost:9002/teacher-dashboard
2. Login as any teacher:
   - `sp8@photon.edu` / `sp8@photon`
   - `mk6@photon.edu` / `mk6@photon`
   - `ak5@photon.edu` / `ak5@photon`
3. Dashboard should load without errors
4. You should see available tests listed

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix:**

### **Teacher Dashboard Will Show:**
- ✅ **Available Tests** section populated
- ✅ **3 sample tests** ready for use:
  - Mathematics - Algebra Basics (60 min, 40 marks)
  - Physics - Motion and Force (45 min, 30 marks)  
  - Chemistry - Periodic Table (50 min, 35 marks)
- ✅ **No more API errors**
- ✅ **Full dashboard functionality**

### **Teachers Can:**
- ✅ View their created tests
- ✅ Create new tests
- ✅ Manage existing tests
- ✅ Upload study materials
- ✅ View test results

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

### **Check Server Console:**
Look for any remaining API errors in your terminal where you ran `npm run dev`

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any JavaScript errors
4. Share any error messages you see

### **Test Individual APIs:**
```bash
# Test if tests API works
curl http://localhost:9002/api/tests/available

# Test if study materials API works  
curl http://localhost:9002/api/supabase/study-materials
```

## 📋 **Database Schema After Fix:**
```sql
tests table will have:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- title: TEXT (test title)
- description: TEXT (test description)
- subject: TEXT (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry)
- duration_minutes: INTEGER (test duration)
- max_marks: INTEGER (maximum marks)
- is_active: BOOLEAN (test is active)
- is_published: BOOLEAN (test is published)
- questions: JSONB (test questions array)
- created_by: UUID (teacher who created)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Teacher dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ "Available Tests" section shows sample tests
- ✅ No "Failed to fetch" errors in console
- ✅ Teachers can navigate all dashboard sections
