# Teacher Addition Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Add three teachers to Supabase so they can login to the teacher dashboard:

1. **Shiv Prakash Yadav** - Photon ID: `sp8@photon` - Password: `sp8@photon`
2. **Mahavir Kesari** - Photon ID: `mk6@photon` - Password: `mk6@photon`
3. **AK Mishra** - Photon ID: `ak5@photon` - Password: `ak5@photon`

## 🔧 Current Status
- ✅ Database schema is properly configured
- ✅ RLS policies are in place
- ✅ User profile triggers are working
- ❌ Teachers need to be created (auth users + profiles)

## 📋 Available Methods

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
**Easiest and most reliable method**

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `decoyxbkcibyngpsrwdr`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**
4. Click **"Add user"** for each teacher:

| Teacher | Email | Password | Confirm Email |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Shiv Prakash Yadav | `sp8@photon.edu` | `sp8@photon` | ✅ Yes |
| Mahavir Kesari | `mk6@photon.edu` | `mk6@photon` | ✅ Yes |
| AK Mishra | `ak5@photon.edu` | `ak5@photon` | ✅ Yes |

### Method 2: SQL Script
**For advanced users**

Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
# File: create-teachers-supabase.sql
```

### Method 3: Self-Registration
**Let teachers create their own accounts**

Teachers can register at your app's signup page using the credentials above.

## 🔍 Verification

After creating the teachers, run the verification script:
```bash
node verify-teachers.js
```

This will check:
- ✅ Auth users exist
- ✅ User profiles are created
- ✅ Roles are set correctly
- ✅ All data is properly linked

## 📊 Expected Result

After successful setup, you should see:

```
📈 Summary: 3/3 teachers are ready to login
🎉 All teachers are set up and ready to login!
```

## 🔑 Login Credentials

Once created, teachers can login using:

| Name | Email | Password | Photon ID |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Shiv Prakash Yadav | sp8@photon.edu | sp8@photon | sp8@photon |
| Mahavir Kesari | mk6@photon.edu | mk6@photon | mk6@photon |
| AK Mishra | ak5@photon.edu | ak5@photon | ak5@photon |

## 🛠️ Files Created

2. `create-teachers-supabase.sql` - SQL script for direct creation
3. `verify-teachers.js` - Verification script
4. `TEACHER_ADDITION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## 🚨 Important Notes

2. **Run verification script** to confirm everything works
3. **Test login** with one teacher account
4. **Inform teachers** of their login credentials

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase project permissions
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
